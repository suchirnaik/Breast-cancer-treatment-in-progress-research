 # Expert System for Medical Diagnosis

## Overview
This repository contains an expert system for medical diagnosis developed in adherence to the NCCSN (National Center for Clinical Services Network) guidelines. The system leverages a machine learning model in combination with forward chaining for the inference engine. Additionally, it incorporates advice and insights from medical experts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the diagnostic capabilities.

## Key Features
- **NCCN Guidelines Compliance**: The system is built according to the established guidelines set by NCCN to ensure standardization and quality in medical diagnosis.\
- **Machine Learning Model Integration**: Utilizes a machine learning model for data analysis and diagnosis prediction, enhancing the system's accuracy.\
- **Expert Advice Integration**: Inputs from medical experts have been incorporated to refine the diagnostic process and provide more accurate assessments.\
- **Forward Chaining Inference Engine**: The inference engine is based on forward chaining, allowing for step-by-step reasoning to reach conclusions based on provided data and rules.\

## Usage
To use the expert system, follow these steps:
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the requirements file.
2. **Data Input**: Input patient data as required by the system for diagnosis.
3. **Execution**: Run the main script or application to trigger the diagnostic process.
4. **Result Interpretation**: Receive the diagnosis or recommendations based on the provided inputs.
